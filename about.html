    <p class="story">Our family owned classic french cuisine restaurant is set in the beautiful landscape of the napa valley. Our building was orginally built in the early 1900's by a stonemason and was constructed with river rock and timbers. In the 1920's it became a French steam laundry and in 1978 it was renovated while keeping as much of the original structure and history as possible. We believe in sourcing only the finest ingredients along with providing an impeccable guest experience.  Our farm to table concept provides a seasonal menu based upon our peak of perfection items from the farm. With this in mind; our tasting menu changes daily.  In addition, since 2007 our restuarant has received the honor of being awarded a 3 star Michelin restuarant. We are proud to say that our property has been in the family since 1994 and provides beautiful scenery and amazing garden landscapes.</p>
